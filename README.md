## Description

This project uses the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) in order to show movies, tv shows, and people. Also, for styles it uses modules and Sass.

The project is currently in development and there are a few things that need to be added or fixed, a list of those things is next:

- Add more filters
- Fix the "sort by" filter so it keeps the values.
- Add more elements to the homepage
- Improve pagination to show previous page numbers before the current page
- Add movie, tv shows and people info to the grid cards
- Add single pages for people and tv shows
- Add a search page using a debounce function when typing the query
- Add styles to all pages so it looks better and it is responsive
